## Main projects

These are some of the most important repositories:

* [PhaserEditor2D-v3](https://github.com/PhaserEditor2D/PhaserEditor2D-v3): contains the code of the IDE (the client side). This is the biggest piece of the editor.
* [PhaserEditor-v3-docs](https://github.com/PhaserEditor2D/PhaserEditor-v3-docs): the source files and images of the [Phaser Editor 2D Help](https://help.phasereditor2d.com/v3).
* [phasereditor2d-launcher](https://github.com/PhaserEditor2D/phasereditor2d-launcher): the code of the [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/phasereditor2d-launcher) for launching Phaser Editor 2D Core.
* [helpcenter-phaser3](https://github.com/PhaserEditor2D/helpcenter-phaser3): contains the code of the [Unofficial Phaser Help Center](https://helpcenter.phasereditor2d.com). It is a powerful tool for browsing the Phaser code and examples.

Other important resources are the [Phaser Editor 2D Starter projects](https://phasereditor2d.com/start):

## Starter resources

The starter resources are projects you can use for starting a new project, or starting learning Phaser Editor 2D.

### Starter templates

The basic templates for starting a new project:

* [starter-template-basic-javascript](https://github.com/PhaserEditor2D/starter-template-basic-javascript): the simplest project template.
* [starter-template-basic-typescript](https://github.com/PhaserEditor2D/starter-template-basic-typescript): a simple TypeScript-based project template.
* [starter-template-webpack](https://github.com/PhaserEditor2D/starter-template-webpack): a WebpackJS project template. The one I recommend for starting a large or professional project.

### Starter examples

Some basic game examples you can see for learning Phaser Editor 2D features:

* [starter-example-sunny-land](https://github.com/PhaserEditor2D/starter-example-sunny-land): an example of using [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) tilemaps and Arcade physics.

## Commercial

A huge part of Phaser Editor 2D is open source. However, it is a commercial product, and it requires a license for using it at its full potential:
